# Does Helping Hurt

## Intro and Background
- does aim assistance in fps game adhere to the *guidance theory* which states that players become reliant on assistance if it is applied throughout the learning phase
- aim assistance is extremely popular as it is known to have a positive impact on all players
  - aim assistance applied to low skill players will help them overcome challenge and achieve flow
  - high skill players playing against aim assisted low skill players enjoy the experience more due to increased challenge
- skill development was divided into three phases (Fitts and Posner's three stage model)
  1. cognitive
  2. associative
  3. autonomous
- learning is most effective in *flow state*
- feedback and assistance can be divided into
  - **Knowledge of Performance** (KP) <br> provides feedback of the quality or pattern of play (i.e. trigger pressed too early, aim too high)
  - **Knowledge of Results** (KR) <br> indicate level of success of an action (i.e. hit markers, enemy death or points)
