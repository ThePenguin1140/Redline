# Does Helping Hurt

## Intro and Background
- does aim assistance in fps game adhere to the *guidance theory* which states that players become reliant on assistance if it is applied throughout the learning phase
- aim assistance is extremely popular as it is known to have a positive impact on all players
  - aim assistance applied to low skill players will help them overcome challenge and achieve flow
  - high skill players playing against aim assisted low skill players enjoy the experience more due to increased challenge
- skill development was divided into three phases (Fitts and Posner's three stage model)
  1. cognitive
  2. associative
  3. autonomous
- learning is most effective in *flow state*
- feedback and assistance can be divided into
  - **Knowledge of Performance** (KP) <br> provides feedback of the quality or pattern of play (i.e. trigger pressed too early, aim too high)
  - **Knowledge of Results** (KR) <br> indicate level of success of an action (i.e. hit markers, enemy death or points)

## Study
- 18 participants
  - novice gamers only
- custom fps game
  - unreal engine + NFringe
- 5 day experiment
- beginning and end of week there was a *shooting gallery* game to asses aiming skills of the players. This was used as a baseline for learning and skill development.
- Throughout the week participants played the game which consisted of a walkthrough a level with simple bots, unlimited ammo
- Used bullet magnetism for aiming assistance
- variables
 - for the shooting gallery the following variables were used to asses performance
   - score, hit ration and headshots
 - walkthrough variables
   - hit ratio, headshots, deaths, time
 - also measured
    - competence and autonomy (PENS)
    - interest-enjoyment and pressure (IMI)
    - suspense (Moulard's Suspense scale)
    - Attribution (Player Attribution scale)

## Results

 - aim assist lead to greater increase in performance
 - aim assist throughout skill development phases did not have a significant difference on skill development when removing the assistance
 - perceived competence was higher with assistance present

 # THE EFFECTS OF NAVIGATION ASSISTANCE ON SPATIAL LEARNING AND PERFORMANCE

 - paper explores the impact navigation assistance techniques have on learning and performance of wayfinding tasks.
 - does the guidance hypothesis apply to navigation assistance?
 - focuses on incidental learning
 - conducted 2 studies
   1. Relationship assistance provided for navigation of an unfamiliar environment and route-finding ability and player experience.
       - online Study - 30 MTurk (15f 15m)
       - single session
       - 3 levels of assistance - large map available on demand (M key)
         1. No assistance
         2. moderate assistance - minimap
         3. strong assistance - path in the game world
       - two maps (Quake and Wolfenstein)
       - training consisted of 8 navigation tasks with assistance
       - testing phase consisted of four more navigation tasks without assistance as well as questionnaires
       - **RESULTS** assistance reduce the amount of time required to complete a task, less time looking at the map and shorter distance travelled. **No reduction in performance**. Assistance also resulted in less perceived effort and frustration, higher performance and lower mental demand.
         - Removing assistance after training with it for testing did not have a significant impact on player experience
   2. Multi day study (3 days) to observe long term effects of navigation assistance techniques. Study 1 was basically duplicated but now with more sessions
      - 46 MTruk participants
      - **RESULTS** only new results was that training with assistance reduce anxiety, longer training did not have any significant impacts

  **Notes**
  - Should probably create a profile of what kind of participants we're targeting on MTurk
  - Should set an FPS requirement and also record that in our data
  - State anxiety may provide some interesting data
  - Effects were most pronounced short term
