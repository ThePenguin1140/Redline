Alright Rookie, we're gonna put you through our standard training a few times to see what you're made of.

Your goal will be to put out the fires in our training room. Don't worry about staying safe, if it gets too hot we'll pull you out. You'll have 1 minute to complete each exercise. If you can't get it on your first try you'll get another shot later!

Remember, time is of utmost importance and will determine if you're good enough to join the team!
