You are an off-duty firefighter and see a house fire starting. You phone for help and the rest of your crew is on the way, but while you're waiting you might as well try to put out the fire. The fire crew will take XX seconds to arrive. Be careful that you don't get too close or you might have to pull out. If you do happen to put the fire out before the fire crew arrives you will have bragging rights in the fire hall! Get to it!
