<h2 id="intro-and-background">Intro and Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>does aim assistance in fps game adhere to the <em>guidance theory</em> which states that players become reliant on assistance if it is applied throughout the learning phase</li>
<li>aim assistance is extremely popular as it is known to have a positive impact on all players<ul>
<li>aim assistance applied to low skill players will help them overcome challenge and achieve flow</li>
<li>high skill players playing against aim assisted low skill players enjoy the experience more due to increased challenge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>skill development was divided into three phases (Fitts and Posner's three stage model)<ol>
<li>cognitive</li>
<li>associative</li>
<li>autonomous</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>learning is most effective in <em>flow state</em></li>
<li>feedback and assistance can be divided into<ul>
<li><strong>Knowledge of Performance</strong> (KP) <br> provides feedback of the quality or pattern of play (i.e. trigger pressed too early, aim too high)</li>
<li><strong>Knowledge of Results</strong> (KR) <br> indicate level of success of an action (i.e. hit markers, enemy death or points)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="study">Study</h2>
<ul>
<li>18 participants<ul>
<li>novice gamers only</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>custom fps game<ul>
<li>unreal engine + NFringe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>5 day experiment</li>
<li>beginning and end of week there was a <em>shooting gallery</em> game to asses aiming skills of the players. This was used as a baseline for learning and skill development.</li>
<li>Throughout the week participants played the game which consisted of a walkthrough a level with simple bots, unlimited ammo</li>
<li>Used bullet magnetism for aiming assistance</li>
<li>variables<ul>
<li>for the shooting gallery the following variables were used to asses performance<ul>
<li>score, hit ration and headshots</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>walkthrough variables<ul>
<li>hit ratio, headshots, deaths, time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>also measured<ul>
<li>competence and autonomy (PENS)</li>
<li>interest-enjoyment and pressure (IMI)</li>
<li>suspense (Moulard's Suspense scale)</li>
<li>Attribution (Player Attribution scale)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<ul>
<li>aim assist lead to greater increase in performance</li>
<li>aim assist throughout skill development phases did not have a significant difference on skill development when removing the assistance</li>
<li>perceived competence was higher with assistance present</li>
</ul>
